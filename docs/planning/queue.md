description: The authoritative order, dependencies and current state of MeridianDB's iterative Java and Maven implementation work.

# Implementation queue

This file owns current execution state. Follow the [workflow](index.md); read the
selected [roadmap card](roadmap.md) for its outcome and acceptance criteria.
The initial rows are high-level work packages. Expand a broad row into bounded
children before implementation rather than treating a whole milestone as one patch.

## Current checkpoint

- Active executable item: **none**. Next source-ready item: **MDB-0006**.
- MDB-0005 source acceptance is complete: memory-only embedded engine, immutable
  read views, serialized atomic publication, retries, canonical/seeded conformance,
  lifecycle/concurrency checks and a runnable Java example. See the
  [engine guide](../development/embedded-engine.md) and [progress receipt](progress.md).
- Before claiming MDB-0006, resolve the MDB-0005 completion commit by its trailers,
  confirm it reached remote `main`, and inspect Java Linux/Windows checks, example
  execution, documentation checks and automatic Pages publication. Resume delivery
  first if any attributable failure remains.
- MDB-0006 defines local storage capabilities and a commit journal; refine that
  package if necessary. Durable engine integration and recovery remain MDB-0008.
- Documentation changes pushed to `main` publish automatically under the
  [website guide](../contributing/documentation.md#initial-hosting-and-publication).

## Ordered work

| ID | Work item | Parent | State | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [MDB-0001](roadmap.md#mdb-0001-planning-workflow) | Establish the plan and iteration workflow | — | done | — |

| [MDB-0005](roadmap.md#mdb-0005-embedded-in-memory-engine) | Build an embedded in-memory engine | — | done | MDB-0004 |
| [MDB-0006](roadmap.md#mdb-0006-local-storage-and-journal) | Define local storage capabilities and a commit journal | — | ready | MDB-0005 |
| [MDB-0007](roadmap.md#mdb-0007-immutable-segments-and-manifests) | Implement versioned immutable segments and manifests | — | queued | MDB-0006 |
| [MDB-0008](roadmap.md#mdb-0008-durable-engine-and-recovery) | Integrate durable commits, reopen and recovery | — | queued | MDB-0007 |
| [MDB-0009](roadmap.md#mdb-0009-temporal-query-operators) | Implement temporal query operators and interval scans | — | queued | MDB-0008 |
| [MDB-0010](roadmap.md#mdb-0010-compaction-and-retention) | Add history-preserving compaction and reclamation | — | queued | MDB-0009 |
| [MDB-0011](roadmap.md#mdb-0011-object-storage-backend) | Add an object-storage backend and conformance checks | — | queued | MDB-0010 |
| [MDB-0012](roadmap.md#mdb-0012-reproducible-workload-baseline) | Establish reproducible workload measurements | — | queued | MDB-0011 |
| [MDB-0013](roadmap.md#mdb-0013-measured-layout-and-index-experiments) | Evaluate layouts and indexes against the baseline | — | queued | MDB-0012 |
| [MDB-0014](roadmap.md#mdb-0014-prototype-release-candidate) | Prepare a reproducible prototype release candidate | — | queued | MDB-0013 |

Selection is top to bottom among eligible executable rows. The initial dependency
chain keeps the core design coherent; split tasks may expose genuinely independent
work without changing the parent outcomes. Add rows and dependencies as evidence
demands. Keep blocked rows in place with an explicit checkpoint and unblock action.

## State meanings

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| queued | Planned outcome; prerequisites or refinement remain |
| ready | Source prerequisites met; confirm remote delivery and CI before claiming |
| active | The one executable item currently owned by an invocation |
| blocked | Unfinished; checkpoint names the concrete dependency and unblock condition |
| expanded | Non-executable parent whose required child steps are tracked separately |
| done | Source acceptance criteria met; verify its completion commit on remote main before advancing |
| deferred | Useful possible work outside the selected near-term path |
| cancelled | Retained identity with a documented owner-approved reason or superseding task |

Update the current checkpoint and table together at each iteration. When committing
completion, the next row may be prepared as `ready` in the same commit; its
execution remains conditional on that completion commit reaching remote `main`
and on resolution of any relevant CI failure. See the [progress history](progress.md)
for dated evidence, not for live selection.

## Ideas beyond this prototype

SQL or another public query language, network services, replication, multiple
writers, language wrappers and native internals are future options. They are not
implicit prerequisites of MDB-0014. Admit a concrete task when an owner requirement
or measured limitation supplies its outcome and completion criteria.
