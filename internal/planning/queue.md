description: The authoritative order, dependencies and current state of MeridianDB's iterative Java and Maven implementation work.

# Implementation queue

This file owns current execution state. Follow the [workflow](index.md); read the
selected [roadmap card](roadmap.md) for its outcome and acceptance criteria.
The initial rows are high-level work packages. Expand a broad row into bounded
children before implementation rather than treating a whole milestone as one patch.

## Current checkpoint

- Active executable item: **none**. MDB-0018's source acceptance is complete.
- The immutable history codec preserves exact original transaction ranges, rejects
  incomplete/corrupt whole objects and validates separate footer/full-object hashes.
  Maven verification passes 165 tests, including 27 independent segment cases.
- MDB-0007 remains **expanded** with required MDB-0018 done, MDB-0019 ready and
  MDB-0020 queued. Original parent criteria and MDB-0008's dependency remain intact.
- **MDB-0019 is ready** after verifying MDB-0018's completion on remote `main` and
  Java Linux/Windows/examples, documentation checks and automatic Pages publication.
  Resolve attributable delivery failures before claiming the next child.
- MDB-0018 supplies byte-array types/codec only; no local immutable files, reader
  lifetimes, manifests, checkpoint durability or engine persistence is implemented.
- MDB-0016 completion/repair `bdf86a0` / `490f8ab` were verified on remote `main`
  before selection. The repair's Java Linux/Windows/examples passed; its predecessor's
  unchanged public documentation checks and Pages publication passed.
- Use the [progress history](progress.md) and completion trailers for exact evidence.

Selection is top to bottom among eligible executable rows. The initial dependency
chain keeps the core design coherent; split tasks may expose genuinely independent
work without changing the parent outcomes. Add rows and dependencies as evidence
demands. Keep blocked rows in place with an explicit checkpoint and unblock action.

## State meanings

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| queued | Planned outcome; prerequisites or refinement remain |
| ready | Source prerequisites met; confirm remote delivery and CI before claiming |
| active | The one executable item currently owned by an invocation |
| blocked | Unfinished; checkpoint names the concrete dependency and unblock condition |
| expanded | Non-executable parent whose required child steps are tracked separately |
| done | Source acceptance criteria met; verify its completion commit on remote main before advancing |
| deferred | Useful possible work outside the selected near-term path |
| cancelled | Retained identity with a documented owner-approved reason or superseding task |

Update the current checkpoint and table together at each iteration. When committing
completion, the next row may be prepared as `ready` in the same commit; its
execution remains conditional on that completion commit reaching remote `main`
and on resolution of any relevant CI failure. See the [progress history](progress.md)
for dated evidence, not for live selection.

## Ideas beyond this prototype

SQL or another public query language, network services, replication, multiple
writers, language wrappers and native internals are future options. They are not
implicit prerequisites of MDB-0014. Admit a concrete task when an owner requirement
or measured limitation supplies its outcome and completion criteria.
