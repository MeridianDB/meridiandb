title: Implementation queue
description: The authoritative order, dependencies and current state of MeridianDB's iterative Java and Maven implementation work.
---

# Implementation queue

This file owns current execution state. Follow the [workflow](index.md); read the
selected [roadmap card](roadmap.md) for its outcome and acceptance criteria.
The initial rows are high-level work packages. Expand a broad row into bounded
children before implementation rather than treating a whole milestone as one patch.

## Current checkpoint

- No active item. **MDB-0044 — MeridianDB visual identity** is delivered:
  twin-arch m SVG masters, light/dark outlined wordmarks, six PNG exports, README
  integration, website logo/favicon and a public download page. The avatar PNG is
  ready to upload; no GitHub account avatar was changed.
- Source completion `16a1fe5fe6839738f8f1fffdb5b3a8c270929304` is on origin/main
  with matching tips. Documentation checks **41234117182** and automatic Pages
  **41234117111** succeeded. Public brand page/header/favicon, README SVG loading,
  search and the 50-page sitemap pass; all **11 live asset files** match exactly.
  The prior Sponsors description refresh is also delivered; see progress history.
- Self-contained SVG, decoded PNG dimensions/transparency/size, repeatable exports,
  circular crop and 16/24/32-pixel previews pass. Strict public builds pass for both
  URL layouts and restored production output (**50 pages**); inspect desktop and
  390-pixel light/dark use, navigation and search. Brand maintenance owns the SVG
  masters/exporter, renderer pin and attribution. Queue/card checks retain 44 IDs.
- Delivery readback is retained in progress history; Git supplies its receipt's
  commit/push evidence. It triggers no additional configured workflows. No Maven or engine
  runtime change. A separate hosting observation remains: Pages reports
  https_enforced=false and certificate state dns_changed; the project-host redirect
  lands on HTTP while the canonical HTTPS site and assets work. Record the finding
  for scoped hosting follow-up; logo work changes no DNS or HTTPS setting.
- **MDB-0036 — Optional S3-compatible object access** remains ready and is the next
  engine item. Refine optional packaging and a controlled SDK/HTTP fixture with
  fresh Maven artifact research. No engine/Maven work or next item starts here.

Selection is top to bottom among eligible executable rows. The initial dependency
chain keeps the core design coherent; split tasks may expose genuinely independent
work without changing the parent outcomes. Add rows and dependencies as evidence
demands. Keep blocked rows in place with an explicit checkpoint and unblock action.

## State meanings

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| queued | Planned outcome; prerequisites or refinement remain |
| ready | Source prerequisites met; confirm remote delivery and CI before claiming |
| active | The one executable item currently owned by an invocation |
| blocked | Unfinished; checkpoint names the concrete dependency and unblock condition |
| expanded | Non-executable parent whose required child steps are tracked separately |
| done | Source acceptance criteria met; verify its completion commit on remote main before advancing |
| deferred | Useful possible work outside the selected near-term path |
| cancelled | Retained identity with a documented owner-approved reason or superseding task |

Update the current checkpoint and table together at each iteration. When committing
completion, the next row may be prepared as `ready` in the same commit; its
execution remains conditional on that completion commit reaching remote `main`
and on resolution of any relevant CI failure. See the [progress history](progress.md)
for dated evidence, not for live selection.

## Ideas beyond this prototype

MDB-0041 records the optional one-writer/read-only-follower replication direction
and its planning acceptance criteria. It remains deferred, separate from storage
adapters and outside MDB-0014's dependency chain. SQL or another public query
language, network services, distributed leadership, multiple writers, language
wrappers and native internals are further options. Admit a concrete executable
task when an owner requirement or measured limitation supplies its scope; recording
an extension direction does not implement or start it.
