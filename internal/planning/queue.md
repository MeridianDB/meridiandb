description: The authoritative order, dependencies and current state of MeridianDB's iterative Java and Maven implementation work.

# Implementation queue

This file owns current execution state. Follow the [workflow](index.md); read the
selected [roadmap card](roadmap.md) for its outcome and acceptance criteria.
The initial rows are high-level work packages. Expand a broad row into bounded
children before implementation rather than treating a whole milestone as one patch.

## Current checkpoint

- No executable item is active. **MDB-0033's source criteria pass**: `reclaim`
  recomputes complete owner-bound inventory under both owners, forces journal and
  retained manifest/segment names, retires/synchronizes obsolete metadata before
  unused dependencies, then syncs and releases protection before a receipt.
- Close **MDB-0031** (inventory plus removal) and **MDB-0028** (reader protection
  plus reclamation): original reader/alias/retention/interruption/capacity criteria
  pass. **MDB-0010 remains expanded** until required MDB-0029 integrates canonical/
  seeded semantics, actual compaction/removal, crash/recovery and space evidence.
- Next source-ready item: **MDB-0029 — Verify compaction, reclamation, crash and
  temporal conformance**. Confirm this completion on remote main and inspect Java,
  documentation and automatic Pages outcomes before claiming it. Preserve all
  original parent criteria; an implementation receipt is not the integrated gate.
- All **840 local tests** and **thirteen examples** pass without skips. New removal
  coverage is 71 unit/fault, 15 real integration and seven child-JVM halt cases.
  Both URL layouts pass documentation QA for **44 pages**.
- Known live-reader contention defers all removal. Explicit retained/backup IDs
  must exist; unknown/orphan/diagnostic objects and full journal/controls stay retained.
  Pending candidates refuse cleanup. Reopen recomputes; interrupted metadata
  retirement can leave preserved orphan segments, with no stale-preview sweep or
  persistent intent. Post-delete-attempt IO/runtime failure is explicitly uncertain;
  native-close quarantine and independent protection/publisher cleanup remain intact.
- Inventory graph budgets remain separate from owner-journal I/O and repeated
  per-delete identity checks. Removal uses no new object slot besides the previously
  reserved permanent guard. A full-entry case recovers publication headroom, but
  retained-root/diagnostic/comparison pressure can still prevent cleanup progress.
- Prior `2ffdfef3101b5cbd1c322a5863162ba5300c6cd0` matched origin/main; Java
  40941178083, docs 40941178045 and Pages 40941177915 passed. Its handoff verified
  exact 42-page live content/search/sitemap. Git/workflows own current delivery state.

Selection is top to bottom among eligible executable rows. The initial dependency
chain keeps the core design coherent; split tasks may expose genuinely independent
work without changing the parent outcomes. Add rows and dependencies as evidence
demands. Keep blocked rows in place with an explicit checkpoint and unblock action.

## State meanings

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| queued | Planned outcome; prerequisites or refinement remain |
| ready | Source prerequisites met; confirm remote delivery and CI before claiming |
| active | The one executable item currently owned by an invocation |
| blocked | Unfinished; checkpoint names the concrete dependency and unblock condition |
| expanded | Non-executable parent whose required child steps are tracked separately |
| done | Source acceptance criteria met; verify its completion commit on remote main before advancing |
| deferred | Useful possible work outside the selected near-term path |
| cancelled | Retained identity with a documented owner-approved reason or superseding task |

Update the current checkpoint and table together at each iteration. When committing
completion, the next row may be prepared as `ready` in the same commit; its
execution remains conditional on that completion commit reaching remote `main`
and on resolution of any relevant CI failure. See the [progress history](progress.md)
for dated evidence, not for live selection.

## Ideas beyond this prototype

SQL or another public query language, network services, replication, multiple
writers, language wrappers and native internals are future options. They are not
implicit prerequisites of MDB-0014. Admit a concrete task when an owner requirement
or measured limitation supplies its outcome and completion criteria.
